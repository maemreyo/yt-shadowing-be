## Integration Required

To fully integrate the admin module into your application, you need to:

### 1. Update app.ts
Add the following imports and initialization:

```typescript
// Import admin module
import { initializeAdminModule, shutdownAdminModule } from './modules/admin';

// In bootstrap function, after other module initializations:
await initializeAdminModule();
logger.info('Admin module initialized');

// In gracefulShutdown function:
await shutdownAdminModule();
```

### 2. Update FastifyServer route registration
In your FastifyServer implementation (likely in `src/infrastructure/server/fastify.ts`), add:

```typescript
// Import admin routes
import adminRoutes from '@modules/admin/admin.route';

// In the route registration section:
await app.register(adminRoutes, { prefix: '/api/admin' });
```

### 3. Update middleware registration
Ensure the following middleware are properly integrated:
- JWT verification middleware (already referenced in routes)
- Role verification middleware (already referenced in routes)

### 4. Required Services
The admin module depends on these services which should already exist:
- ✅ AuditService (exists in `src/shared/services/audit.service.ts`)
- ✅ StorageService (exists in `src/shared/services/storage.service.ts`)
- ⚠️ SubscriptionService (should be in billing module)

## Background Jobs

The following recurring jobs are automatically scheduled:
- **Audit log cleanup**: Daily at 3 AM (90-day retention)
- **Metrics aggregation**: Every 5 minutes
- **Health checks**: Every 5 minutes

## Security Features

1. **Role-based access control**: ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN roles
2. **IP whitelisting**: Optional restriction by IP address
3. **Rate limiting**: Configurable per-endpoint limits
4. **Audit logging**: All admin actions are logged
5. **Session validation**: Admin sessions are tracked and validated

## Configuration

The module uses both environment variables and dynamic configuration:

### Environment Variables (add to .env)
```env
# Admin Module
ADMIN_IP_WHITELIST=
ADMIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600
ADMIN_RATE_LIMIT=1000
AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=90
EXPORT_MAX_RECORDS=100000
```

### Dynamic Configuration
System settings can be updated via the API without deployment.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the integration**: Ensure all endpoints work correctly
2. **Set up monitoring**: Configure alerts for critical metrics
3. **Configure permissions**: Set up proper admin roles and permissions
4. **Enable features**: Configure which features should be enabled
5. **Set up backups**: Regular exports of critical data

The Admin Dashboard API module is now ready to provide comprehensive administration capabilities for your SaaS application!
